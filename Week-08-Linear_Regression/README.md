# Linear Regression
Although a traditional subject in classical statistics, you can also consider Regression from a machine learning point of view. You'll learn more about the predictive capabilities and performance of regression algorithms. At the end of this chapter you'll be acquainted with simple linear regression, multi-linear regression. So let's take the first step into Machine Learning Algorithms






## Learning Objective
After this session , you'll be able to
1. Understand the intuition behind Linear Regression
2. Understand the different notations used in Linear Regression
3. Understand the Linear Regression Cost Function
4. Understand the Gradient Descent Algorithm and the differences between Closed Form Solution and Gradient Descent
5. Learn about the assumptions in Linear Regression Algorithm
6.Apply Linear Regression algorithm in Python using sklearn

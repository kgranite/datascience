# Logistic Regression
In this session we'll  explore how to build a predictive model for classification problems. In classification, our target column has a finite set of possible values which represent different categories a row can belong to. We'll focus on a classification technique called logistic regression.


## Learning Objective

After this session , you'll be able to
1. Understand and apply the Logistic Regression algorithm
2. Understand Gradient Descent in Logistic Regression
2. Get in-depth knowledge about the various Evaluation Metrics
3. Learn how to tune hyperparameters using Grid Search and Random Search

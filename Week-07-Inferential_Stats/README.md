# Inferential Statistics
One of the foundational aspects of statistical analysis is inference, or the process of drawing conclusions about a larger population from a sample of data.For example, to show that one medical treatment is better than another, we can assume that the two treatments lead to equal survival rates only to then be disproved by the data. Additionally, we introduce the idea of a p-value, or the degree of disagreement between the data and the hypothesis. We also dive into confidence intervals, which measure the magnitude of the effect of interest (e.g. how much better one treatment is than another).


## Why complete this?
The objective of this notebook is to get you acquainted with the required skills for working on the analytical part of
a dataset and how to get your data correct statistically to infer better results.   


## Learning Objective
After this lesson, you'll be able to
1. Learn how to build hypothesis
2. Understand Type I and Type II errors
3. Learn how to apply the chi-squared test to determine if observed data follows an expected pattern
